This is an implementation of Ruby rspec for behavioral testing, in Common Lisp.

Usage:
See the rspec docs at ***, and the example file example.lisp.

Load the example file to run it with the default options, or do this to run it with
custom options:
  (specify run "example.lisp" :format html :output "example.html")
